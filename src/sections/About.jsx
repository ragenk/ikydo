      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Rafael — or Ikydo online. I'm a Front-End developer with a clean and minimalistic approach to building user experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey started back in 2004, when I took my first web development course. I later graduated as an Electromechanical Engineer (Electronics) at the Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo. However, my passion for web development led me to pursue a career in this field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today I work with WordPress and Shopify, and I'm currently specializing in React to build modern, fast and responsive interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of development, I'm a gamer, anime fan, tech enthusiast, crypto curious, and now deeply interested in AI.
